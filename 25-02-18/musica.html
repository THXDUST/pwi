    I've always been the one to say the first goodbye<br />
    Had to love and lose a hundred million times<br />
    Had to get it wrong to know just what I like<br />
    Now I'm falling<br />
    <br />
    You say my name like I have never heard before<br />
    I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure<br />
    I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all<br />
    Are you falling?<br />
    <br />
    <i>Centre of attention<br />
    You know you can get whatever you want from me<br />
    Whenever you want it, baby<br />
    It's you in my reflection<br />
    I'm afraid of all the things you could do to me<br />
    If I would've known it, baby<br />
    <br />
    I would've stayed at home<br />
    'Cause I was doing better alone<br />
    But when you said: Hello<br />
    I knew that was the end of it all<br />
    I should've stayed at home<br />
    'Cause now there ain't no letting you go<br />
    Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?<br />
    <br />
    Oh no, I was doing better alone<br />
    But when you said: Hello<br />
    I knew that was the end of it all<br />
    I should've stayed at home<br />
    'Cause now there ain't no letting you go<br />
    Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?<br /></i>
    <br />
    I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind<br />
    Two can play that game, but you win me every time<br />
    Everyone before you was a waste of time<br />
    Yeah, you got me<br />
    <br />
